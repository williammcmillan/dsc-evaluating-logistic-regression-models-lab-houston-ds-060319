    "# Evaluating Logistic Regression Models - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    " In regression, you are predicting values so it made sense to discuss error as a distance of how far off our estimates were. In classifying a binary variable however, a model is either correct or incorrect. As a result, we tend to deconstruct this as how many false positives versus false negatives we come across.  \n",
    "In particular, we examine a few different specific measurements when evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. In this review lab, we'll review precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score in order to evaluate our logistic regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:  \n",
    "* Understand and assess precision, recall, and accuracy of classifiers\n",
    "* Evaluate classification models using various metrics\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's take a moment and review some classification evaluation metrics:  \n",

    "  \n",

    "$Recall = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Number of Actual Total Positives}}$  \n",
    "  \n",
    "$Accuracy = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives + True Negatives}}{\\text{Total Observations}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{F1-Score} = 2\\ \\frac{Precision\\ x\\ Recall}{Precision + Recall}$\n"

    "At times, it may be superior to tune a classification algorithm to optimize against precision or recall rather than overall accuracy. For example, imagine the scenario of predicting whether or not a patient is at risk for cancer and should be brought in for additional testing. In cases such as this, we often may want to cast a slightly wider net, and it is much preferable to optimize for recall, the number of cancer positive cases, then it is to optimize precision, the percentage of our predicted cancer-risk patients who are indeed positive."
